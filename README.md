# SmartParkingBikes

---------------Bicycle Parking Project for Smart City----------------

When starting the program, the position of a bicycle or platform to take is requested. You can insert a value in X not less than 0 and not greater than 17, and a value Y between 0 and 14. When choosing a position in X equal to or less than 8, it is automatically assumed that the first half of the matrix of platforms (also greater than or equal to 9 takes the second half of the building to take out the bicycle).
Then in the consoles is displayed a representation of the route that the bicycle must take to go out with the time that it takes.
